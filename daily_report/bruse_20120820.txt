						Mother Love
		Every child was surrounded by the Mother Love,but we always don't understand our mother 
	that time.One day Tom hurried home for lunch after school,because there would be an exam in the 
	afternoon,he expected to go to school early to prepare for the exam.Now he was very hungry,but the food 
	were not ready,he felt unhappy.after long time his mother took the food on table,Tom found there
	was no food he love to eat.He run out home angrily walk around on the road for a while.Then he 
	went to school without  eating food.After he arrived at school he felt tired.When he went to his 
	desk he found a box ,he opened it there was his favorite food.That was his mother who bought the food 
	for him.Mother loved her child without return.it's the greatest love.
