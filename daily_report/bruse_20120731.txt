						   Teenager
	Many teenagers feel that the most important people in their lives are their friends. They believe that their family members, and in particular their parents, don’t know them as well as their friends do. In large families, it is quite often for brothers and sisters to fight with each other and then they can only go to their friends for advice.
	It is very important for teenagers to have one good friend or a circle of friends. Even when they are not with their friends, they usually spend a lot of time talking among themselves on the phone. This communication is very important in children’s growing up, because friends can discuss something difficult to say to their family members.
	However, parents often try to choose their children’s friends for them. Some parents may even stop their children from meeting their good friends.Only because the parents worry about their children making some bad frends,that a expression of love,but the children need good frend too.So it is difficult for the parents to choose frends for their children.
