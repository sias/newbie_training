				Zoo
	I have went to the Zoo in my holiday once.It was the first time,
maybe the last time.Before that I was expected to  go to a Zoo to see the
animals.I was excited as I saw the beautiful birds and the strong tigers,
I want to touch them and make friends with them.But when I prepare to have 
a photo with a elephant,he looked afraid,I can see his sad thought hit big 
eyes.He looked at me though the big cage,if he want to go out,If he was asking me
"why you kept me in this cage,I want to go out‚Äù.I realized that all the animals 
didn't like to stay in the zoo.If animals are our friends,why don't we let 
them go home.From then on I was disgusting to go to the zoo.
