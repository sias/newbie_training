	Today is 7th  July,it is the Valentine's Day in china today.Every holiday has a story in china.
There is  a beautiful story about the Valentine's Day.It is said long long ago a fairy comes down to 
the Human World from the heaven,one day she meet a man named NuLang.Cowherd is a handsome diligent man.
They fall in love soon.But good time don't last long.The Jade Emperor knows the thing,the law in the 
heaven forbid  the fairy to love a human.Then she is taken back to the heaven,from then on the 
Jade Emperor forbids her leave the heaven.The Weaving Girl crying every day and cowherd always waits 
for her coming in the Human World.The Jade Emperor is touched.He allows them to meet on 7th July every year.
