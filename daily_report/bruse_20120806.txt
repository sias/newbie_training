						Music
	Music must be one of the greatest invention ,now we nearly can't live without music .The music  exist  everywhere,birds talk in the forest,wind  blowing the trees,children laugh on the road . Because of  the music the world  full of colorful . In my opinion we can judge a man's feelings from the music he was listen to . When we are happy we often listen to beautiful music,and when we feel sad we need  a sad music . Through it we can feel more emotion,sometimes it make us relaxed.
        I don't  know who create the music,who sing the first song . But I know we need music,technology make us touch music easily . Now we can heard music from MP3 player,from TV,from computer,from mobile phone . There are many kinds of music,I love the Rock Music most . It's the food of my spirit.Because of the music the world become more colorful.
