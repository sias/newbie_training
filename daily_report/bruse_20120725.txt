									Water
	Water is the base of life,every life can't exist without the water.Researcher said that the fresh water only account for 2.7 percent of water in the world.
so water is  precious resources,Our country also do many things to protect water,for example Public Service Advertising and some laws for protecting water.
       We can say that if you don't drink water one day ,you may feel very thirsty,if you don't drink water last one week.you will not see the eighth day's sun.Although that,many people still waste or pollut water.now we can nearly sea a fresh river,but often see someone is wasting water.whether they are ready to welcome the 2012.
      I think we should do more to protect the water,Taking the thing of protecting water as duty,if everyone to do the same thing,all things will be easy.
