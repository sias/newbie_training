									Water
	Water is the base of life,every life can't existence without the water.Research say that fresh water only account for 2.7 percent of water in the world.
so water is  precious resources,our country also do many things for protect water,for example Public service advertising and some laws for protecting water.
       We can say if you don't drink water one day ,you may feel very thirsty,if you don't drink water last a week.must you are over.Although that,many people still waste or pollut water.now we nearly can sea fresh river,but often sea someone are wasting water.
      I think we should do more to protect the water,if every one to do the same thing,all things will be easy.
