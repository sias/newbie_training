					Android
	Today is my first day to learn Android system,it's a new challenge for me.
I have known the name  of Android for a long time,it's the most popular phone system 
by now.It is bought by Google in 2005.Now it is supported by Google and other forty Open 
Handset Alliance.They run the plan of opening source.It permit the factory and the developer 
to make the mobile suit themselves,without worrying about being complainted.
	As smart phone system Android has reached to a hight level.If you have a smart phone,
you can listen music watch video catch medias and do many other thing.I think in the future
more functions will be added  into  the smart phone.Mobile phone will have more functions.
	One day maybe we can control our Air-conditions and cars though the phone.
