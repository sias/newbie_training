						Android
	Today is my first day to learn Android system,it's a new challenge for me.
I have know the name  of Android for a long time,it's the most popular phone system 
by now.it is bought by Google in .Now it is supported by Google and other forty Open 
Handset Alliance.The plan of open the origin code permit the factory and the developmentor 
to make the mobile  suit  themselves without worrying about being  complaint.
	As smart phone system Android has reached to a hight level.If you have a smart phone,
you can listen music watch video catch medias and do many other thing.I think in the future
more functions will be added  into  the smart phone.Mobile phone will be more tools' carrier.
One day maybe we can control our Air-conditions and cars thought the phone.
