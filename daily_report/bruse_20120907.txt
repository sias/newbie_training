				Financial budget
	Five hundreds is enough for us to spend when we were senior students,
after going to university we need to spend at least one thousand one month.
Before having to work to earn money ourselves,we do not know that it's harder to 
earn money than to spend it.Now we have to live and do everything depend 
on ourself.So when you receive your salary,do you have the plan to do something.
	 We know money is very important,but you need to consider how to deal 
with your limited money more.If you have two thousands to consumption,what would 
you like to do?some one choose to buy a mobile or clothes,they think money is used 
to be spent only.But do you believe that some one can use money to create money.it is
true that using two thousands some one could do many things to change two thousands 
to three thousands even more.I think using less money to buy good things is a good way too.
