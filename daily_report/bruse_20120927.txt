			Oportunities and capabilities
	Opportunities and capabilities,which is more important?This question 
seemed simple.A lot of people think that ability is the first,so many people 
will have to spent a lot of time to learn computer,learn English,study mechanical 
engineering,learning to drive,and so on.Do everything possible ro improve their 
batteries,they intent to learn more skills applicable to maintain their basic living.
Because they have always belived that if work hard they can be successfull.Because 
there are too many incentive story affect them.
	For most people,an opportunity is more important than ability,because there 
are few opportunities but many people have the great ability,so we should use our 
capabilities to create opportunities.
