			Attitude
	Attitude is important to us in our life,the right attitude always be 
the key to be success.A men's attitude habit isn't born,it is developed in our 
road of life.I think the teacher and the parents play important roles on the 
developing of our attitude.A good teacher not only teacher  us knowledge but 
also other important things, as how to be a real man,how to develop the right 
attitude.The attitude can  decide one's all life.There are good men and bad men,
poor men and rich men in the world,I think its the  different attitude create 
different men.
	    There are many criminal cases every year,most of the sinner are 
uneducated.So we should take care of the case seriously.
