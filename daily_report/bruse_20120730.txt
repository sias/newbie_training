			       Read Book
	Now the electronic technology is advancing rapidly,so you can learn knowledge in many ways.For example if you want to learn English you can watch video,read E-book,listen to audio,but I think reading book is the most useful method.Although you should spend more time on reading book than watching the video to know about some English words.
	People often say "do everthing youself",as study the best way is read book youself,if you learn something from the video or the audio,maybe you can easily know about it but only in a short time.On the contrary if you learn something from reading book it may take you more time,but you should remember the knowledge for a long time.Because you have study by youself.
	So I think  no matter how much the technology advance,reading book must be the most effective method to learn.We should take the videos and audios as aiders.
