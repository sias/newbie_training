						Myopia eye				
	The eyes are the window of our soul,we use them to see the color ,to see the 
things around us,and to attribute to others.The eyes are extremely mportant to us.So 
we should protect it in daily life.
	But a survey shows that there are almost 500 millions of blind people in our 
country,and nearly one thousand people with low vision,especially in children and young 
people.The occur of preventing the children and young leaving far from myopic eye is 
fouced by the  parents and the community. Why there are more and more young people 
suffering from myopia? How did the children get  myopia eye? Just bad habits?
	I think there are many cases can lead to myopia.Seeing a lot of TV, reading in 
a wrong posture, over use the eyes, do not know to adjust the eyes, playing computer 
games more. Some  myopia is caused due to genetic, but most is caused because the 
acquired bad lifestyle and learning style.
