				 Time

	The time is valuable.we don't know what is the time ,it has no physical form 
we can't see and feel it.It only be used as a measure tools just like kilogram.Some one 
had said  that the time is truly exist but we cant find the way  to touch it now.
	An author has described the time as life.I think that is right. If we don't arrange 
our time in daily life,it would cause many troubles.for example you will be late for working,
miss a meeting,even loss of integrity.So time is important to us,now the company and school have 
used time to make their management system be perfect. A man has no concept of time will not be 
recognized by society.We should have the habit of doing every thing on time.
