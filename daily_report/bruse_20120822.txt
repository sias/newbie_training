						Life
	The life is like a strict teacher to me,it teaches  me  to know many things that can't learn 
from books.I see many thing in the life and to feel them ,the life let me know many truth.It makes my 
thought become more and more mature.That was called grow up.
	I often lay on the bed to think many things that have happened on myself,the weet memories  make 
me feel joyful and the bad memories make me understand my own shortcomings.I think no matter what life 
experience you have.It must be your wealth.Failure is the mother of success,also success  is the mother 
of the next success.The life give us more than we can learn from book.But there are many people disgusting 
ther current life,I want to say “Tcherish your life no matter good or bad.”
