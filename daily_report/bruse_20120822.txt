						Life
	The life is a strict teacher to me,it teaches  me  many things that can't learn 
from books.I see many thing in the life and  feel them ,the life lets me know the truth.It makes my 
thought more and more mature.That is called grow up.
	I often lay on the bed to think many things that have happened on myself,the sweet memories  make 
me feel joyful and the bad memories make me understand my own shortcomings.I think no matter what life 
experience you have.It must be your wealth.Failure is the mother of success,also success  is the mother 
of the next success.The life gives us more than we can learn from book.But there are many people do not satisfy
their current life,I want to say “value your life no matter good or bad.”
