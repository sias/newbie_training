								An  Unlucky Man
	One day when we was talking in the dormitory,some one knocked the door.When I open the door ,it was Jim who live in the next door of my dormitory.But there are many sweats on his head.He quickly ran into the home speaking with a trembling voice,”my iphone was stolen on the bus!please dial my telephone number to see if it can be connected”.I dialed the number,but his telephone had been shutdown.We say many words to comfort him,I know it useless. He leaved  in a disappointment.
	Several days later he buy a new telephone,and he took it in his hand all time.But one day I saw him did not take the telephone.I got to ask him”friend where is your telephone ?”,he said, “I took my telephone go to bed but it fail from the bed.Now it is in the Mobile phone repair shop."
