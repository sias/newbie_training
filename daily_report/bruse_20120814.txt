								An  Unlucky Man
	One day when we were talking in the dormitory,some one knocked on the door.When I open the door ,it was Jim who lived next to my dormitory.But his head was covered with big drops of perspiration.He quickly run into the home and spoke with a trembling voice,”my iphone was stolen on the bus!please dial my telephone number to see if it can be connected.”.I dialed the number,but his telephone had been shutdown.We talked a lot to comfort him,I knew it was useless. He left  in a disappointment.
	Several days later he buy a new telephone,and he took it in his hand all time.But one day I didn't see him take the telephone.I went up to ask him”friend where is your telephone ?”,he said, “I took my telephone to bed but it falls from the bed.Now it is in the Mobile phone repair shop."
