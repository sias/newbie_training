						Autumn
	I arrived Kun Shan on February 19,I remembered that a cool day.At the time I felt this strange     place is beautiful,I like the fresh air ,the clear river,and the enthusiasm people.Now I have stay here for about six monthes,Athough it's a short time but it include The spring ,The summer ,The autumn. Pass the hot summer ,I was happy for the autumn's coming.The temperature is lower than several days before.People looks spirit,and we have full energy to work.People always say autumn is a season of harvest.I think that is wright.I receive my first salary today.
	There are many holidays in autumn the National Day,the Double Ninth Festival day,The Mid Autumn Day.So we have much time to do many thing in the holiday.
