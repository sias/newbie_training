			Yesterday
	Yesterday I went to Suzhou to meet one of my old classmates,I got up 
early in the morning with a bread to wait for the twenty seventh bus.There were 
too many people get on the bus,and I standed thirty minutes,that was a bad journey.
When I arrived the north railway station it was already ten o'clock,I bought the 
ticket and got on the train.The train was so fast that it only took me ten minutes 
to arrive Suzhou,when I went out from Suzhou railway station.My friend  had been
waiting for me a long time.We were glad to meet each other,like a brother.
The night we drank much bear and talked for a long time.I nearly remebered we went 
to bad at three o'clock in the night.
