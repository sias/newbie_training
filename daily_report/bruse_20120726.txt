							My Last Day
	

	Yesterday was a bad day,I didn't know why I didn't hear my alarm clock.When I get up it was a quarter to eight already.I jumped from the bed going out whithout combing my hair.Luckly I catched the last bus,this thing let me known the last bus left at ten past eight.When I arrived at the company it was nearly late.
       Then I have many things to do,the time going so fast.At noon I went to the restaurant buy a bowl of noodles,to everyone eating is a nice thing.Time going fast,it was time to leave work,everyone was busying to go home.But I had many things to be complate.I always leaved at half past eight in the night.When I arrived at the dormitory it was nearly nine o'clock.Then I eated my dinner,after the dinner I went to my dormitory,I opend the door while my roommates were playing computer game.The dormitory is a happy place.I went to the bathroom took a shower ,lay on my bed, it was the happiest moment.
