							My Last Day
	

	Yesterday was a bad day,I didn't know why I didn't hear my alarm clock.when I get up it was a quarter to eight already.I jumped from the bed going out whithout combing my hair.luckly I catched the last bus,this thing let me known the last bus leving at ten past eight.when I arrived at the company it nearly late.
       Then I have many things to do,the time going so fast.At noon I went to the restaurant buy a bowl of noodles,To me eating is a nice thing.time going fast,it was time to leave work,everyone was busying to go home.but I had many things to be complate.I always leaved at half past eight in the night.when I arrived at the dormitory It was nearly nine oclock.then I eated my dinner,afer the dinner I went to my dormitory,when I opend the door my roommates were playing game.the dormitory is a happy place.I went to the bashroom took a shower laying on my bed it was the happiest moment.
