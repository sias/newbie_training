									Dare To Try
		I have seen an article wrote by a programmer,it said about the difficult he faced and how did he solve them.
	To a new programmer even a little problem is a big problem.So there was  a long difficult  way for a new programmer 
	to  pass.Obviously,he had faced lots of problems.Every time he had to spend much time on solving the  questions
	,the only tool was books.he said,when he faced the question that he didn't  know.He would first read some books about 
	the question and tried to solve it first .In older to knew about a question he may  tried many times.There was a segment 
	of words said,”It is my happiest time,the question which have worried me  four days has be solved now!”.The habit 
	enhance his ability to deal with problems.Now he can solve a problem in a short time.
		So when we face  problems try to solved it in many ways,even if fail.We should dare to try our best to 
	face the question.
