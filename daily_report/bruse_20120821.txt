									Dare To Try
		I have seen an article wrote by a programmer,it said about the difficult he faced and how did he solve them.
	To a new programmer even  little problem is a big problem.So there was  a long difficult  way for a new programmer 
	to  pass.Obviously,he had faced lots of problems.Every time he had to spend much time on solving the  questions
	,the only tool is a book.he said,when he faced the question he  don't  know.He would first read some book about 
	the question and try to solve it first .In older to know about a question he may  try many times.There was asegment 
	of words said,”It is my happiest time now,the question which have worried me  four days be solved now!”.The habit 
	enhance his ability to deal with problems.Now he can solve a problem in a short time.
		So when we face  problems you should try to solved it in many ways,even if we will always failure.
	We should dare try our best to face the question.
