		I have seen an article written by a programmer,it said about the difficulty he faced and how he did to solved them.
	To a new programmer even a little problem is a big problem.So there was  a long difficult  way for a new programmer 
	to  go.Obviously,he had faced lots of problems.Every time he had to spend much time on solving the  bugs
	,the only tool were books.He said,when he faced the bugs that he didn't  know.He would first read some books about 
	the issue and tried to solve it first .In order to know about a bug he may try many times.There was a segment 
	of words said,”It is my happiest time,the bug which bother me four days has been solved now!”.The habit 
	enhances his ability to deal with problems.Now he can solve a problem in a short time.
		So when we face  problems try to solve it in many ways.even if, we may fail.We should dare to try our best to 
	face the issue.
