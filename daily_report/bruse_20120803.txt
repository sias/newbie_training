									Weekend
	The weekend is coming.If you have been busying working five days ,do dou expect the weekend.If tomorrow is Saturday do you have make your plan for the weekend.When I was a student,I expect the weekend to come quikly very much,I always have many things to do at that time,I was interested in playing basketball,watching moves,andswimming.so I always felt the time past so fast,although very tired but very happy.Now the weekend is coming,but I am not a bit happy.The summer in Kun Shan is too hot,and I have few frends here.A boring weekend.I want to do something to rest and relax,but I don't know what to do.
	I have never felt like this before.I miss my frends classmates,now we are all old boys.We have to work hard for life.I hope every one have a good weekend.Now I have a plan,maybe I should talk with them on QQ chat tool this weekend.
