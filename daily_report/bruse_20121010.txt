				Rational patriotism 					
	Recently,because of the Diaoyu Islands issue, Chinese people are against Japan.
They call for a boycott of Japanese goods.The things develop into a bad direction.Some 
people smash the stores of our compatriots in the name of patriotism.They even hurt the 
people who have Japanese goods.In my opinion,these behaviors are harmful to our siblings. 
Even worse,these behaviors are illegal. We love our motherland and we want to protect it, 
but we can’t hurt our fellows and we can’t damage their properties.these people are not 
defending our country, while they are damaging our country and destroying our reputation. 
As a real Chinese, we should defending our motherland on the base of not hurting ourselves,
our compatriots and our country.
