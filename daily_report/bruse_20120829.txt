						Computer
	Since  computers become ordinary in our life,the people don't feel boring any more. 
When  we are free we can spend time to surf the internet.Computers bring us so much happiness.
We can play games listen music or watch movie on the computer.
	Now the computer has been a part of our life,like the mobile phone.As a young I used to 
play game s on computer,the workers have to use computer to communicate with the customers.The 
policy need use computer to monitor public.Every coin has two sides.It bring much troubles at the 
same time.Many younger are addicted to playing games.Some bad men run the bad web throw the computer.
I hope we can take computer as a useful tool,but don't controlled by it.
