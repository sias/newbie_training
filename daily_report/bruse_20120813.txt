									 Emotions

	What makes we smile? Mostly, I don't like the man who try to make someone else feel bad. I have to admit that once, when I was really feel bad , I did not answer my frend's question ,that time I must make him feel bad. I regretted doing this afterwards, but not full heartedly because I think I had no energy in that situation.
	I think the most positive way of dealing with emotion is talking about the problem. I talk to someone who listens, or I'll write my thoughts down on paper.Learning how to deal with emotion is so important. When we're young, we might yell, or cry when we're angry, but as we get older, we're expected to handle our emotions much better. Learning to control our emotion now will prevent we from doing something that we'll regret later on in life!
