				The beautiful Autumn
	Autumn is a beautiful season,I love autumn,because of the temperature 
is not too hot and too cool,the fresh ear  and the particular scenery.Having  
leaving the hot summer we welcome the autumn.We always connect autumn to busing 
work,now the farmer have been ready to harvest the crops.As a worker I should work 
hard to harvest my gain too.Autonm is also a good time for us to have a travel,we 
can go to Huong Son to sea bright red maple leaf,go to Mount  Huan to sea the sun
raising,go to zhou zhuang town to feel the local customs and conditions.It is wise
to choice to travel in autumn,without walking under the sun or in the snow,you can 
enjoy your travel only.
	There are several important festivals in autumn,such as autumn day and national
day,that means we can have a long holiday.then we can get back home to reunite with our
family. to enjoy delicious moon cakes. I think its important to spend more time to stay
with our parents,besides the long holiday offer enough time for us to do release ourselves  .
