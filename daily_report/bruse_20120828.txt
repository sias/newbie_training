					Make The Plan Is Important
	An old saying"The early bird will catch worms" tells us that if people want to be successful,they 
must have a plan and make their efforts to overcome all the difficulties.
	For example, the Chinese athletes' excellent performance in the Olympic is because the result of 
their early planning and hard training. If they don't have the strenth aim and do much hard work, even though 
they have the best talents, they can't compete with others and get medals.
	Another case in study.Maybe someone was good at English,but he couldn't pass the exam, because 
he weren't prepared well before the examination.he had many other things to solve at that time. The 
reason was that he had no plan in many things and didn't study hard,so they failed.
	In a world,the saying tells us the important of planning,working hard and make the plan earlily.
