				Dorm life
	I miss the dorm life, happy and beautiful.We are carefree when live with our 
friends,Turning on our computers at the beginning of a day.We sometimes forget 
to brush our teeth, wash our faces. Even forget to eat,when the computer has been
a necessity for us.We have  a simple life and simple friendship.Now we work outside
the home, more and more problems came to trouble us.The autumn temperature becomes 
no longer so mild, I looked at the leaves slowly turn yellow,Smell the soil fragrance
after the rain, feeling the time to give us the gift .When I walk lonely in the sky
after the rain, thinking of those who are in the distant but let us not forget the
people, How are you my frends.
