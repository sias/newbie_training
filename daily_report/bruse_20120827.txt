						Lunch
	It was fifty past eleven,all workers  went out the office to had lunch,I was no hurry 
to the factory canteen,to have lunch and to return to the office.I arrived at the canteen ,there 
were many people.I stood at the end of the queue.Waiting for my turn pationtly,I smelled the aroma 
of the  food.It might be chicken.The food prepared by the factory was in rich nutritional value to 
that found every where. 
	The  shedule of the factory was busy,thus have lunch was a real time when workers could sit
down and enjoyed the pleasure food.I liked to sit by the window ,then I could see the sky when I enjoy 
the food.After lunch we all went back to office,To ave a little time's sleeping.
