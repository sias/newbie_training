									Char Device Driver
	There are three kinds of drivers in linux they are "char device driver","block device driver" and "network device driver".The char device driver is the simplest one.If you want to study the char driver you must know about three structures:"struct file","struct file_operations","struct inode".many head files and some importent device functions.
	When you want to creat a char driver,at the begening you need to define a device structures to express a simple device driver with writing some methods as "open","release" "read","write" and so on.Next initializat the structtures of "file_operation".In the middle you should set Module initialization function,it includes getting the device number,apply device space and regist it,but don't forget to release the space you applied.At last you should creat the unloading function adding the license in the tail.
