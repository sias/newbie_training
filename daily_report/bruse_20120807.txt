									Weather Report
              Today I receive  a message,it says “Because of the  Typhoon  named Hai Kui,  there will be  a rainstorm  and big wind in recent two days”.Then I should take a umbrella tomorrow in case of the rain . I think the Weather Report is very useful to our life . When I want to do something I always depend on the weather,for example if tomorrow is sunny I choose to play basketball,if it's rainy day I choose to stay at home or to supermarket . Now our life was closely linked to the weather,when you want to make a plan see the Weather Report first.
            I remember a thing occur  on myself,that is a weekend . I went to barbecue with my friends,that is a sunny day,after  we  reached  the park  we  begin to make fire and  take the food . We  talked and laughed .At that time the day change to be dark ,we look up to the sky,the sun is blocked by the cloud,the rain is coming . We  had to give up the barbecue that day .In my option ,knowing about the weather before  you do something is very important.
