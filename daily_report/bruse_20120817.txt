										Shopping  
	When I want to buy things on Internet,I should first think about how much I can pay for the thing and if I really need the thing.After that I can  choose one shop.But,there are many shops sold the same thing that I want to buy. How should I do.I always spend much time to choose a shop as I want to shopping  something .Because,if I want buy thing from the Internet I can only see the picture,then I can't know about its size or quality.The only way to buy a good thing in a lower price is to find a good shop.When I choose the shop ,one side I will browse the shop's sale volumes,the other side I browse the evaluations.If they are both good I will buy thing in that shop.I think buy a good thing on lower price is a pleasant thing.
