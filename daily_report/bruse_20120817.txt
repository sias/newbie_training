										Shopping  
	When I want to buy  things on Internet ,I should first make my mind to deal how much I can pay for  the thing.And if I really need the thing.After that I can  choose one shop.But ,there are many shops sale the same thing I want to buy. How should I do.I always spend more time to choose a shop as I want to buy  something .Because,if I want buy thing from the Internet I can only see the picture,then  I can't know about it's size or quality.The only way to buy a good thing in a lower price is to find a good shop.When I choose the shop ,first I will see the shop's sale volumes,then I see the  evaluations.If the are both good I will buy thing in that shop.I think buy a good thing on  lower price is a pleasant thing.
