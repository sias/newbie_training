   Today is my first day working in wistron company,it's my first job in my life too. the work and dormitory enviroment here is better,the only inconvenient is there are too many people.especially when you want to take bus. 
   here I need to study many new knowledge for example drive android ,it's very difficult.but luckly my colleagues give me many help and I have certain basis.so I 
belive I should smooth pass the assessment three mouths latter.
