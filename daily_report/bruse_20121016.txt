				Christmas
	It is said that long long ago,there was a kind old man and his name 
was Saint Nicholas.He was always ready to help the poor and often gave presents 
to them.Today,Father Christmas is an mythic man,but nearly all the children 
believe in him.They think he is a happy old man with a long white beard and a 
long red overcoat.On the night of the twenty fourth of December every year,Father 
Christmas from a cold northern land comes down the chimney to put presents at the 
beds of children or to their stockings.So when children go to bed that night,they 
hang up their stockings,and on Christmas morning they wake to find them full of 
presents.Of course,it's their parents who fill the stockings.
