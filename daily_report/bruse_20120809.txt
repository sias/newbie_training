								A Thing Happend On The Bus
	One day I was take bus to meet one of my old friend in a town,It will took me 40 minutes to reach there .that was  a long distance. I thought it was a good idea for me to have a deep sleep . when I was ready to close my eyes,a old man got on the bus and he stand in front of me . I thought about to give my seat to him.“It's a virtue for a young person to help the old”,I said to myself . when  I was standing up to give my seat to the old man,a girl stood up quickly saying “please sit down”.The old man was happy . I was a little embarrassed because I was siting in the middle of the bus. Now I found that I should have choose a sit  in the end of the bus,if want to sleep . When the bus arrived  at a station a pregnant women got on the bus,it's my time to give my seat. I stand up saying “sit down please”.Finally I stood 40 minutes on the bus to meet my old friends.
