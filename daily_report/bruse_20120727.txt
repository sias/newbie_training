     You must have ever thought about a question that why I have to study so many courses in school, many of the courses looks useless.the question had exist in my cerebrum for a long time.  
      In today’s society, technology advances rapidly especially developments in the fields of science and mathematics. If they do not study the two subjects, students will not be able to contribute to the further development of technology. Furthermore, technological advances everyone’s life. Without a basic understanding of math and science, it is difficult for people to take full advantage of new products and tools. So no matter what one’s field, it is important to study these two subjects. 
      In my opinion, all subjects can contribute to a good education. No matter what one’s interests or future career, it is best to gain some basic knowledge in as many areas as possible. And finally, given the rapid pace of technological advances in our society, the study of science and mathematics is essential.
