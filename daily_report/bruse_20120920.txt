				Train tickets 
	The long holiday is coming. Several days before, I expected 
the holidays' coming with a excited heart.I had plant to participate 
in reunions and to have a rest.But now all of my plan nearly have become dreams.
That because I have not bought the train tickets until now.It's my first  time 
to meet the case,I only know it's diffucultto buy tickets during Chinese
New year Festive.What a pity it is,as you can't go home in the new year.
	There are  so many people in China,that reason lead to the result of someone 
being difficult to go home .If every year is so,why doesn't the government make some 
plan to solve the matter.Maybe we can build more railroads or add more trains.
