				Train tickets 
	Soon we will welcome  a long holiday. Several days before, I expected 
the holidays' coming with a excite heart.I had plant to go home to participate 
in reunions and to have a rest.But now all of my plan nearly have become dreams.
That because I have not bought the train tickets until now.It's my first  time 
to meet the case,I only heard something about being difficult to go home in Chinese
New year time.What a pity it is,as you can't go home in the new year.
	There are  so many people in china,that reason lead to the result of someone 
being difficult to go home .If every year is so,why don't the government make some 
plan to solve the matter.Maybe we can build more railroad or add more train.
