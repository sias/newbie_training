				   	Friends
what are friends and how to get along with our friend.Everyone has his own friend.
when we were young we have several good friends we eat together play together even
fight together.That time if you ask me what is friendship,I must  say “It is every 
thing,I can not live without my friends”.Now I have another definition about  friend 
in my mind,a real friendship  is that when you feel lonely he can talk with you.When
you are in trouble he can help you.When he has troubles he can remember you.
So we know it is good to have as more as good friends,If you have many friends it will 
be easy for you to complete the thing you want to do.
	How to get along with our friends,I think every thing is relative,if you are
kind to others you will get the respect from others.It says “Birds of feather flock
together”,Making  the right friend is important too.
