				How to write an email
	Today I the teacher teach us something about writing email in company.
Before the class begin I thought it was not necessary to listen this class.But
I was wrong.Wistron has its own culture.As a staff in this company I have to 
follow its all.I think the system here is very good.If I do everything under
the management, I should  have a strict and positive habits.
	In daily life, when we send a email to others,we only need to add the
recipient's name and write what you want say to him.But in Wistron you should
add the polite words at first such as “dear”,”hello”.Then you can write the content.
At last you should add your name ,telephone number,department and the date.Except that
we need to be careful about something like don't send email to the man who don't need 
to read,don't add pictures in the email.
	Is important for a man to write a quality email.
